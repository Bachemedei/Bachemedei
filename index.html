                    <p>
                        Since September 2019, I've been working at Adapptor as a test analyst. 
                        I'm responsible for manual testing of our mobile application products along with creating and maintaining test suites. 
                        I enjoy working closely with the developer and product team to understand both the underlying code and user story.

                        Before taking the jump into Tech, I was a molecular microbiologist. 
                        This is still a keen interest of mine and I have aspirations to combine my science and tech backgrounds.

                        Beginning with teaching myself R, I quickly fell in love with software development. 
                        I am lucky to have gained a place in the She Codes Plus program in 2020 which will help me grow my skills even further, 
                        and explore the vast world of programming.

                        <h1>Test Device SlackBot</h1>
                        <p>In 2019, I made a SlackBot using Node.js. We have a heap of test devices at work, 
                            but keeping track of who has what and what’s available was always a struggle. 
                            My bot allows users to ‘check out’ devices, see what is available, and who is currently using a device. 
                            It also stores device information such as operating platform and operating system versions. </p>

                            A personal portfolio of any work we have already done, and a place to present work we will complete during the year. 
                            The website was built using HTML & CSS</p>
